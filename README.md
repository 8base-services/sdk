8base provides a set of client libraries that are helpful when building frontend applications using 8base as a backend.

## Installation

The easiest way to install 8base-sdk is to use NPM and install the package locally in your project, adding it to the `package.json` file:

```shell
$ npm install --save 8base-sdk
```

or, if you are using Yarn:

```shell
$ yarn add 8base-sdk
```

## Getting Started

The 8base SDK is a collection of many different 8base module, like `@8base/auth`. Any of these packages can be installed independently if needed. Once the SDK is installed in a projects `node_modules` folder, it can be imported to necessary scripts.

```javascript
/* Importing full SDK */
import eightBase from '8base-sdk';
// ...or
var eightBbase = require('8base-sdk');

/* Importing specific module */
import { Auth } from '8base-sdk';
// ...or
var Auth = require('8base-sdk').Auth;
```
